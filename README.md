These are [Maze](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Maze) programs, written for my [Maze Interpreter V3](https://github.com/olls/maze-interpreter-v3), which has slight differences from the original Maze descrbed on the wiki. These changes are to make the language nicer and easier to use, as well as behaving  more like a cellular automata. Read the interpreter [Read Me](https://github.com/olls/maze-interpreter-c/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

For a maze intepreter which is (mostly) compatible with the wiki, see my [Maze Interpreter V2](https://github.com/olls/maze-interpreter-v2)
